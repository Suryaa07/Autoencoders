## Overview

This repository demonstrates the application of autoencoders for the analysis of X-ray images. Autoencoders are neural network architectures used for tasks like image compression, denoising, and feature extraction. In this project, we use a simple autoencoder to reconstruct an X-ray image and visualize the reconstruction results.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/xray-autoencoder.git
   cd xray-autoencoder
   ```

2. Replace `xray_image_path` in the script with the path to your own X-ray image.

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python xray.py
   ```

## How it Works

1. **Data Preparation**: The X-ray image is loaded, resized to the desired dimensions (256x256 in this case), and normalized to values between 0 and 1.

2. **Autoencoder Architecture**: We define an autoencoder model with an encoder and a decoder. The encoder consists of convolutional and max-pooling layers to extract features from the input image, and the decoder uses transposed convolutional layers to reconstruct the image.

3. **Model Compilation**: The autoencoder model is compiled with the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and the Adam optimizer for training.

4. **Training**: The model is trained on the X-ray image. The number of epochs, batch size, and other hyperparameters can be adjusted as needed.

5. **Reconstruction**: After training, the autoencoder is used to encode and decode the X-ray image, resulting in a reconstructed image.

6. **Visualization**: The original and reconstructed X-ray images are displayed side by side for comparison.

## Results

The following images show the original X-ray image and the reconstructed X-ray image after training the autoencoder:

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of autoencoders for X-ray image analysis. You can further improve the results by fine-tuning the model architecture and hyperparameters based on your specific use case. Autoencoders are versatile tools that can be applied to various image processing tasks in the field of medical imaging and beyond.
